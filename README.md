# Flask-bas-c-project
My first flask project


There are bugs, but I will update soon.
Since it is my first flask project, I tried to do my best, but it cannot be said that I was very successful.
if you want use this project first of all. You should install requirements.txt

-- pip install -r requirements.txt

and after

open your terminal in 9999 folder. And flask run main.py

the project will run on your local network
